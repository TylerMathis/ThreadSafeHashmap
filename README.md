# wait-free-hashmap
Wait free parallel hashmap implemented in C++.

## Style

Use CamelCase for all names. Start types (such as classes, structs, and typedefs) with a capital letter, other names (functions, variables) with a lowercase letter. You may use an all-lowercase name with underscores if your class closely resembles an external construct (e.g., a standard library construct) named that way.
